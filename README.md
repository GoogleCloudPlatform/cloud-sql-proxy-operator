# Cloud SQL Proxy Operator

*Warning*: This project is in Public Preview, and may contain breaking changes
before it becomes Generally Available.

Cloud SQL Proxy Operator is an open-source Kubernetes operator that automates
most of the intricate steps needed to connect a workload in a kubernetes cluster
to Cloud SQL databases. 

The operator introduces a custom resource AuthProxyWorkload, 
which specifies the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy configuration for a workload. The operator
reads this resource and adds a properly configured Cloud SQL Auth Proxy container
to the matching workload pods. 

## Installation

Check for the latest version on the [releases page][releases] and use the
following instructions. 

Confirm that kubectl can connect to your kubernetes cluster.

```shell
kubectl cluster-info
```

Run the following command to install the cloud sql proxy operator into
your kubernetes cluster:

```shell
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/cloud-sql-connectors/cloud-sql-proxy-operator/v0.1.0/install.sh | bash
```

Confirm that the operator is installed and running by listing its pods:

```shell
kubectl get pods -n cloud-sql-proxy-operator-system
```

## Usage

See the [Quick Start Guide](docs/quick-start.md) for a description of basic usage.
Additional usage may be found in the [Examples](docs/examples/).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why would I use the Cloud SQL Auth Proxy Operator?

The Cloud SQL Auth Proxy Operator gives you an easy way to add a proxy container
to your kubernetes workloads, configured correctly for production use. 

Writing the kubernetes configuration for a proxy to the production level requires
a great deal of deep kubernetes and proxy knowledge. The Cloud SQL Proxy team has
worked to encapsulate that knowledge in this operator. This saves you from having
to know all the details to configure your proxy.
