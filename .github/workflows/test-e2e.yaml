# The test-e2e action does not check out the repo. Instead, it triggers the e2e
# Cloud Build using this action's commit SHA, then waits for the cloud build
# run to complete.
#
# This action uses a Cloud Build trigger rather than `gcloud build submit`
# because we want Cloud Build to check out the repo. We don't want to upload
# the source from this github action.
#
# We don't want e2e build log to be printed in this Github Action's log
# because it may contain secrets.
